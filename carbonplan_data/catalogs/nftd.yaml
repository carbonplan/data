      title: National Forest Type Dataset (raw)
      summary: Extent, distribution, and forest type composition of the nation’s forests.
      description: |
        This geospatial dataset was created by the USFS Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program
        and the Geospatial Technology and Applications Center (GTAC) to show the extent,
        distribution, and forest type composition of the nation’s forests.

        The dataset was created by modeling forest type from FIA plot data as a function of more
        than one hundred geospatially continuous predictor layers.

        This process results in a view of forest type distribution in greater detail than is
        possible with the FIA plot data alone.
