      description: |
        TerraClimate is a dataset of monthly climate and climatic water balance for global
        terrestrial surfaces from 1958-2019. These data provide important inputs for ecological
        and hydrological studies at global scales that require high spatial resolution and
        time-varying data. All data have monthly temporal resolution and a ~4-km (1/24th degree)
        spatial resolution. The data cover the period from 1958-2019.
