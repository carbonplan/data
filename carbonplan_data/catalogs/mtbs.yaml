      summary: Annual burn severity mosaics for the continental United States and Alaska.
      description: |
        Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) is an interagency program whose goal is to
        consistently map the burn severity and extent of large fires across all lands of the
        United States from 1984 to present. This includes all fires 1000 acres or greater in
        the western United States and 500 acres or greater in the eastern Unites States. The
        extent of coverage includes the continental U.S., Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico.

        The burn severity mosaics consist of thematic raster images of MTBS burn severity
        classes for all currently completed MTBS fires for the continental United States,
        Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico. Mosaicked burn severity images are compiled annually
        for each year by US State and the continental United States.
