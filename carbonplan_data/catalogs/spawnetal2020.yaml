      title: Global Biomass (Spawn and Gibbs, 2020)
      summary: Global aboveground and belowground biomass carbon density maps for the year 2010
      description: |
        This dataset provides temporally consistent and harmonized global maps of aboveground and
        belowground biomass carbon density for the year 2010 at a 300-m spatial resolution. The
        aboveground biomass map integrates land-cover specific, remotely sensed maps of woody,
        grassland, cropland, and tundra biomass. Input maps were amassed from the published
        literature and, where necessary, updated to cover the focal extent or time period. The
        belowground biomass map similarly integrates matching maps derived from each aboveground
        biomass map and land-cover specific empirical models. Aboveground and belowground maps were
        then integrated separately using ancillary maps of percent tree cover and landcover and a
        rule-based decision tree. Maps reporting the accumulated uncertainty of pixel-level
        estimates are also provided.
