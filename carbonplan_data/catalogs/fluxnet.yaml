      summary: Supporting metadata for the FLUXNET dataset.
      description: |
        The preparation of this FLUXNET Dataset has been possible thanks only to the efforts of
        many scientists and technicians around the world and the coordination among teams from
        regional networks. The previous versions of FLUXNET Dataset releases are the FLUXNET
        Marconi Dataset (2000) and the FLUXNET LaThuile Dataset (2007). The FLUXNET2015 Dataset
        includes several improvements to the data quality control protocols and the data
        processing pipeline. Examples include close interaction with tower teams to improve data
        quality, new methods for uncertainty quantification, use of reanalysis data to fill long
        gaps of micrometeorological variable records, among others (see the data processing
        pipeline page for details).
