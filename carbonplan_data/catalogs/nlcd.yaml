      title: National Land Cover Database (raw)
      summary: The National Land Cover Database - 2001 to 2016.
      description: |
        The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in partnership with several federal agencies, has
        developed and released four National Land Cover Database (NLCD) products over the past
        two decades: NLCD 1992, 2001, 2006, and 2011. These products provide spatially explicit
        and reliable information on the Nation’s land cover and land cover change. To continue
        the legacy of NLCD and further establish a long-term monitoring capability for the
        Nation’s land resources, the USGS has designed a new generation of NLCD products named
        NLCD 2016. The NLCD 2016 design aims to provide innovative, consistent, and robust
        methodologies for production of a multi-temporal land cover and land cover change
        database from 2001 to 2016 at 2–3-year intervals. Comprehensive research was conducted
        and resulted in developed strategies for NLCD 2016: a streamlined process for assembling
        and preprocessing Landsat imagery and geospatial ancillary datasets; a multi-source
        integrated training data development and decision-tree based land cover classifications;
        a temporally, spectrally, and spatially integrated land cover change analysis strategy;
        a hierarchical theme-based post-classification and integration protocol for generating
        land cover and change products; a continuous fields biophysical parameters modeling
        method; and an automated scripted operational system for the NLCD 2016 production. The
        performance of the developed strategies and methods were tested in twenty World Reference
        System-2 path/row throughout the conterminous U.S. An overall agreement ranging from
        71% to 97% between land cover classification and reference data was achieved for all
        tested area and all years. Results from this study confirm the robustness of this
        comprehensive and highly automated procedure for NLCD 2016 operational mapping.
