      title: Forest Inventory Analysis (raw)
      summary: Data on status and trends in forest location, health, growth, mortality, and production.
      description: |
        The Forest Inventory and Analysis dataset is a nationwide survey of the forest assets of
        the United States. The Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) research program has been in
        existence since mandated by Congress in 1928. FIA's primary objective is to determine
        the extent, condition, volume, growth, and use of trees on the Nation's forest land.
