      summary: High-resolution surface meteorologicaldata covering the conus US from 1979-yesterday.
      description: |
        gridMET is a dataset of daily high-spatial resolution (~4-km, 1/24th degree) surface
        meteorological data covering the contiguous US from 1979-yesterday.
        These data can provide important inputs for ecological, agricultural, and
        hydrological models. These data are updated daily.  gridMET is the preferred naming
        convention for these data; however, the data are also known as cited as METDATA.
